**Perturbation & Gradient-Based Techniques for Explainable AI**

With increasing complexity in data and success of black-box deep learning models in terms of predictive power, it becomes increasingly difficult but important to be able to make sense of model predictions. We evaluate explain-ability in tensorflow models and compare stability of perturbation-based feature attribution methods such as LIME, SHAP and Counterfactual Explanations versus gradient-based methods like DeepLift, Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad, etc.

**Brand Engagement Analysis - NLP and Image analytics**

Crawled images and captions from Instagram posts of Nike and Adidas to study the social media engagement strategy of both companies.
Key attributes are engineering by obtaining labels, presence of people, sentiment from images (GCP Vision API) ; prominent phrases using named entity recognition, key topics using Latent Dirichlet allocation on the captions. The number of likes and comments were regressed against all these attributes to understand the distinguishing factors of highly engaging posts.
