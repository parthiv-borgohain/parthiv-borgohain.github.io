**Surveillance Alert System based on Image Captioning using Deep Learning Approaches**

In the field of image analytics, semantic segmentation can determine the objects in an image, but fails to explain the relationship between these objects. Automatic caption generation can help to identify these events and be used to alert users to take action. Our team tackled this challenge by implementing an Image Captioning system using CNN-LSTM architecture and compared results with GPT2-generated captions. The training dataset was from Kaggle and contained 8092 images from Flickr with 5 captions as the target label. To address the lack of surveillance-related images, we manually added 568 surveillance images and captions. The resulting Image Captioning model generated captions that were used to send alerts to stakeholders if the captions contained red-flag words.

**Crowdsourced Beer Recommendation System**

This project aimed to create a crowdsourced recommendation system for beers using data from Beeradvocate.com, a forum where users share reviews and ratings of different beers. The system took in user preferences for beer attributes and generated three recommendations based on the information. The approach involved scraping data from the website, identifying desired attributes, performing similarity analysis, sentiment analysis, and creating a composite metric to recommend beers. The tools used included Selenium, spaCy, Vader, and NLTK. The results showed that blindly recommending high-rated beers does not meet the needs of a customer looking for personalized recommendations.

**Trump and other Presidents: Speech Analysis**

For a group project in the Unstructured Data Analytics course at UT Austin's MS Business Analytics program, we analyzed the difference in former President Trump's speeches compared to other presidents using the Presidential Speech Archive as our dataset. We used NLP techniques such as SpaCy similarity analysis, Lift Analysis, polarity and subjectivity analysis, and topic modelling with LDA to draw insights on the uniqueness of Trump's language and messaging compared to other presidents. Our findings revealed that modern speeches tend to be more alike, but Trump's speeches were found to have a lot of information on specific, opinionated topics and to focus on nationalist, COVID-19, immigration, and terrorism, while other presidents focused on topics such as war, taxes and economy, crime, and space.

**Index Fund Using Integer Programming**

In this project, we designed an Index fund to track the NASDAQ-100 index using an integer program and a linear program to pick stocks and allocate weights respectively. The performance of the index fund was evaluated for different values of m and compared to the NASDAQ-100 index. The goal was to find a practical and cost-effective way to create an index fund that mirrors the broad market.

**Car Brands Consumer Perception Analysis**

In this project, we analyzed user-generated content from the Edmunds car review forum to understand consumer perceptions of car brands. We used natural language processing techniques and visualized the results with a Multidimensional Scaling plot. Our analysis revealed the top 10 car brands, the attributes associated with those brands, and the most desired brand from the discussions. The insights from this project can inform marketing strategies for car brands.

**M5 Forecasting - Kaggle**

In this competition, the fifth iteration of the Makridakis Competitions, we will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Varied boosting models leveraged as benchmarks and deep learning architectures such as RNNs/LSTMs were explored in order to study the lift in accuracy of forecasts.
