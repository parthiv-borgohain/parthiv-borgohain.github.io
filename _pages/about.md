<br>Hi there, I'm Parthiv. <br>

I am a seasoned Analytics and Data Science professional with 4 years of experience in the industry. My expertise spans across Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reporting, Data Visualization and Data Wrangling. Iâ€™ve delivered impactful results for clients in various domains, including the Government sector, Sales & Marketing, and Supply Chain & Logistics. Additionally, I have experience in Product Analytics in the online gambling industry, where I provided actionable insights to CX Product managers on core products, engagement tools, customer support, and customer journeys.

I am an alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin, where I completed my MS in Business Analytics. My curriculum included advanced courses like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Demand/Pricing Analytics, and Social Media Analytics, topped with a practical Capstone Project in collaboration with Microsoft. Equipped with skills in Python, SQL, SAS, Power BI, AWS, and GCP, I'm eager to delve into challenging Data Science and Analytics projects.
