<br>Hi there, I'm Parthiv. <br>

I am a seasoned Analytics and Data Science professional with 4 years of experience in the industry. My expertise spans across Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reporting, Data Visualization and Data Wrangling. Iâ€™ve delivered impactful results for clients in various domains, including the Government sector, Sales & Marketing, and Supply Chain & Logistics. Additionally, I have experience in Product Analytics in the online gambling industry, where I provided actionable insights to CX Product managers on core products, engagement tools, customer support, and customer journeys.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and have recently completed my MS in Business Analytics from UT Austin - McCombs School of Business. My final semester focused on cutting-edge courses like Deep Learning, Demand/Pricing Analytics, and Social Media Analytics, along with a capstone project in collaboration with Microsoft. With skills in Python, SQL, SAS, Power BI, and more, I'm excited to tackle challenging Data Science and Analytics projects.

I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in this field.
