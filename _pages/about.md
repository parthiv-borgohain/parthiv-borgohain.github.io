<br>Hi, I'm Parthiv. <br><br>

Hi there! I'm an Analytics and Data Science Professional with close to 4 years of industry experience under my belt. I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of Data Science and Analytics projects, which has allowed me to gain expertise in areas like Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling, Reporting, and Data Visualization. I've also honed my skills in data wrangling and modelling, which has helped me deliver insightful and impactful results for clients from various domains like the Government sector, Sales and Marketing, and Supply Chain and Logistics.

In addition to my work experience, I've also had the chance to work in the Product Analytics space in the online gambling industry. Here, I was able to use my analytical skills to help product managers make better decisions by providing them with day-to-day tactical insights and answering their analytical questions related to core products, engagement tools, customer support and customer journeys. I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, and am currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics from UT Austin - McCombs School of Business. In my final semester, I am learning about cutting-edge techniques like Deep Learning, Optimization-II, Demand/Pricing Analytics, and Social Media Analytics, and working on a capstone project with Microsoft. With a wide range of technical skills, including proficiency in Python, SQL, SAS, and PowerBI, among others, I'm confident that I can bring value to any Data Science and Analytics project.
